title: Who's Tejas?
---

Hi! My name is Tejas, I'm currently pursuing an MSc in [Advanced Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/computing/advanced-computing/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). I wanted to come back to university after a few years in industry to push myself academically, culturally, and intellectually, and this experience certainly has been all of those things. I've taken coursework in Deep & Reinforcement Learning, Scalable & Performant Systems, and Computational Finance. I've begun work on my thesis project which is under the supervision of [Dr. Thomas Heinis](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/theinis/) working on Oligoarchive, which aims to use [DNA as archival data storage media](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/theinis/). 

Before coming back to university, I most recently worked as a Senior SWE - Data/Systems at [Oscar Health](https://www.hioscar.com) in NYC. I worked on part of the product, now called [+Oscar](https://www.hioscar.com/plus-oscar) which powers the insurance capabilities of Oscar and their clients. Before that I worked on [distributed private blockchain networks](https://axoni.com/press/blackrock-goes-live-on-axoni-equity-swaps-network/) for capital markets at Axoni, and at [IBM Watson Health](https://www.ibm.com/watson-health) on the security and resiliency of the Cloud product.

Before I made the switch to Software engineering I double majored Computer Science with [Bioengineering at Penn](https://be.seas.upenn.edu), during which I did biomedical research over the summers at the [NIH](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/lab-immune-system-biology) and [UW](https://dev.orthop.washington.edu/research/ourlabs/orthopaedic-science.html).

Take a look at my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o5zNc41ouPT1UD6DmZZ7SNm4jdklmOJM/view?usp=sharing) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjsnryn/) if you're interested in more detail.
